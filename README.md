## Introduction
### Summary 
### Requirements
* Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the hawaii climate database.
  1. Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data and plot as bar chart.
  2. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
  3. Design a query to find the most active stations.
  4. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data and plot as a histogram.
  
* Use this initial analysis to design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
